# BBQ Finder

## What is this?

BBQ Finder is a Mod 3 solo project for the Front-End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Design. The purpose of the project was to demonstrate a good grasp of how to create an app with React framework using Router, testing with Jest, and async JS.

The audience that this app is for is travelers who love BBQ. Using th [Zomato.com](https://developers.zomato.com/documentation#!/common/cuisines) public API, a user can search for BBQ restaurants across thousands of cities in the US. If they find one they would like to go to, they can favorite and save it for later.

## Accomplishments

I'm very happy with the idea for this app, and believe the execution went well. All MVP functionality is met, and it is easy to use. I think that it was a good project for solidifying some areas in React that I felt less sure about my ability with. I think this is a very good starting point for an app that could be quite useful.

## Challenges

Asynchronous testing is the most difficult aspect of React, and the only area that I did not execute. Time became an issue and I had to abondon trying to get testing of my fetch calls to pass in order to complete styling.

## Future Iterations

In future iterations, I'd like to expand the information available per restuarant, and give each one its own information page. The functionality of the favoriting and unfavoriting does not persisit across rerenders, and I'd like to refactor to fix that issue.
