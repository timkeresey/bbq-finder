# BBQ Finder

## What is this?

### Interation 1

The audience that this app is for is travelers who love BBQ. Using the [Zomato.com](https://developers.zomato.com/documentation#!/common/cuisines) public API, a user can search for BBQ restaurants across thousands of cities in the US. If they find one they would like to go to, they can favorite and save it for later, where they can then track whether or not they have eaten at that restaurant.

BBQ Finder is a Mod 3 solo project for the Front-End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Design. The purpose of the project was to demonstrate a good grasp of how to create an app with React framework using Router, testing with Jest, and async JS.

### Iteration 2

The second iteration of this app was done with the purpose of refining and demonstrating front-end development and design capabilities. principles of UI/UX in mind, and refactoring was done to create a much cleaner and more enjoyable user experience. Styling was refactored to utilize advanced SCSS skills, i.e. modules, variables, and nesting. Advanced design techniques were used to create animated and dynamic elements. 

This new iteration was also done to refactor the functionality of react components to incoorporate React Hooks for state management, and refine the apps functionality. Future iterations of this app will include more robust capabilities for favorited restaurants, such as reviewing and expandable information.

## Accomplishments

I'm very happy with the idea for this app, and believe the execution went well. All MVP functionality is met, and it is easy to use. I think that it was a good project for solidifying some areas in React that I felt less sure about my ability with. I think this is a very good starting point for an app that could be quite useful.
